Look up to the sky where raptors may be gliding on thermals, their wings outstretched in silent grace. Look down and notice the tiny worlds beneath your feet—ants marching, beetles scurrying, and wildflowers blooming in bursts of color. Listen closely to the hum of insects, the rustle of leaves, and the songs of birds echoing through the trees. Life is all around you here—vibrant, wild, and waiting to be discovered. Be present, be curious, and let the park reveal its wonders to you."], "timeline": null, "image": ""}
