Some invasive plants integrate into the environment with minimal disruption, blending into the ecosystem without significantly harming native species. Others, however, outcompete local flora, disrupt habitats, and threaten the delicate balance that sustains native wildlife. These more aggressive invaders often require careful removal and replacement with native species to restore ecological health. By understanding which plants are harmful and which have adapted, we can make informed choices that support a more resilient and biodiverse park."], "timeline": null, "image": null}
