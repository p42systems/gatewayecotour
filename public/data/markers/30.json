Nests are usually placed 6 to 20 feet above ground in trees or shrubs, often near water or fruiting plants.", "Interesting facts: Cedar Waxwings can survive on fruit alone for long periods.

The air is alive with the songs of birds that change with the seasons. From the cheerful melodies of warblers in spring to the crisp calls of sparrows in autumn, each visit offers a new chorus. Migratory songbirds pass through in waves, painting the skies and treetops with color and sound as they journey between breeding and wintering grounds. Even in winter, hardy species remain, their songs a quiet echo in the crisp air. Each season brings a new soundtrack—so come back often, bring your binoculars, listen closely, and discover how the park's birdlife changes with the rhythm of the year. Birding here is more than a hobby—it's a peaceful way to connect with nature, to slow down and notice the subtle rhythms of the land.", "image": ""}
