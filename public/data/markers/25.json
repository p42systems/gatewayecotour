What is now a lush, linear green space stretching nearly one kilometre from Riverside Drive to Wyandotte Street was once an abandoned railway cut. In 1999, CP Railway agreed in principle to allow the City of Windsor to transform this neglected corridor into a public park.", "The park's transformation began with community vision and grassroots effort. In 2002, a row of Japanese cherry blossoms was planted through the Sakura Project, a gift from the Consulate-General of Japan symbolizing international friendship. That same year, local real estate agent Jack Renner, inspired by former mayor and parks advocate Bert Weeks, spearheaded the revitalization of the park's northern gateway. With support from local businesses, residents, and the city, the once-barren lot at Cameron and Riverside was turned into a welcoming entrance to what would become Gateway Park.", "In 2021, the City of Windsor signed a 99-year lease with the Detroit River Tunnel Corporation to manage and maintain the park, marking a new chapter in its development. The city committed to revitalizing the space with accessible trails, signage, lighting, and amenities, ensuring it would serve as a safe, inclusive, and ecologically rich corridor for generations to come.", "Today, Gateway Park is not only a peaceful retreat with views of the Detroit River but also a vital ecological corridor that supports biodiversity and connects Windsor's urban core to its natural heritage."], "image": ""}
