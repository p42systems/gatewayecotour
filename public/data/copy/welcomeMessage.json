    "Step into the heart of nature without leaving the city. Welcome to Gateway Park, a vibrant ecological corridor nestled near downtown — where trails lead you through a rich mosaic of deciduous trees, native plants, fluttering insects, and the songs of birds overhead. This digital walking eco-tour invites you to **look, listen, and learn about** the many ecological treasures that make Gateway Park a sanctuary for both wildlife and people.",
    "As you explore, you'll encounter the park's habitats — from shady thickets of trees to flowering meadows — each teeming with life. Discover the mammals that roam quietly at dawn, the pollinators that dance among wildflowers, and the vital role each species plays in this interconnected ecosystem.",
    "Urban natural parks like Gateway are more than green spaces — they are **essential lifelines** for biodiversity, climate resilience, and community well-being. They filter air and water, reduce urban heat, support mental health, and provide a refuge for countless species in the midst of the city's bustle.",
    "So take a deep breath, open your senses, and let Gateway Park reveal its wonders — one step, one story, one species at a time."
