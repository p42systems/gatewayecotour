    "This walking eco-tour was lovingly created by the students at the Public Alternative Secondary School located next to Gateway Park in the Mason Educational Centre with funding provided by the Go Wild School Grants from the World Wildlife Federation. And you'll be hearing me, Bronwen Wood, science teacher at PASS and nature enthusiast. Enjoy your walk through this tour and I hope you learn something that inspires you."
